# Project Neighborly Frontend

The Project Neighborly frontend is a dynamic, user-friendly interface built with React and TypeScript, powering a platform that connects users needing household chores, neighbors (helpers) offering assistance, and admins managing operations. Styled with Tailwind CSS, it leverages React Query for efficient data fetching, Redux and Redux Persist for state management, and Axios for API calls. Features include interactive visualizations with Chart.js and React Chart.js, location mapping with React Leaflet and MapPin, event scheduling with Big Calendar, form validation with Yup, and icons from Lucide React.
